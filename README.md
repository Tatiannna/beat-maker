# Beats

### Background

Beats will allow users to create, customize and stack music tracks to create beats! The intuitive interface will allow users to experiment with beat-making with a variety of sound/instrument options.


### In this project, users will be able to create beats by utilizing a simple interface that will allow users to...
- Select from a library of sounds/instruments
- Add these sounds to tracks, and play them at customized intervals
- Stack tracks to play different instruments simultaneously
- Add further customization with track volume controls, tempo adjustments, and other options
