## Implementation Timeline

### Friday Afternoon & Weekend
Have UI skeleton completed. Have all toggles and buttons created. Decide on the set(s) of sounds/instruments the app will have available as options. Create classes/methods to handle the audio logic (playing sounds at user-selected intervals/frequencies, stopping, pausing, etc.).

### Monday
Decide on which of the styling themes that I have in mind to implement and begin. 

### Tuesday
Finish styling. Implement features that were originally deemed optional, that time allows, like track randomize() and rhythm-based animation.

### Wednesday
Polishing, Finishing touches, deployment.
